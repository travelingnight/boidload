An Ideal daemon process should satisfy the following conditions
according to PEP 3143.

-Close all open file descriptors.
-Change current working directory. (chdir)
-Reset the file access creation mask. (umask)
-Run in the background.
-Disassociate from process group.
-Ignore terminal I/O signals.
-Disassociate from control terminal. (first fork)
-Donâ€™t reacquire a control terminal. (second fork)
-Correctly handle the following circumstances:
    -Started by System V init process.
    -Daemon termination by SIGTERM signal.
    -Children generate SIGCLD signal.

I don't think mine is technically a daemon, as I want any given computer
to be able to communicate with it.

        messages such as
        
        umount: /usr: device is busy
        
        you will be familiar with the problem. The root directory may not 
        always be the best choice - sometimes it is more appropriate to 
        change to the directory containing all your daemons data files.
        Then if the sysadmin tries to unmount that directory, the device 
        busy message may be a good reminder that there exists a process 
        which still needs that data.'"""

        """Fantastic answer regarding why we use setsid to change the newly
        forked processes group ID to itself.
        
        'Calling setsid is usually one of the steps a process goes through 
        when becoming a so called daemon process. (We are talking about 
        Linux/Unix OS)
        
        With setsid the association with the controlling terminal breaks. 
        This means that the process will be NOT affected by a logout.
        
        There are other way how to survive a logout, but the purpose of 
        this 'daemonizing' process is to create a background process as 
        independent from the outside world as possible.
        
        That's why all inherited descriptors are closed; cwd is set to an 
        appropriate directory, often the root directory; and the process 
        leaves the session it was started from.
        
        A double fork approach is generally recommended. At each fork 
        the parent exits and the child continues. Actually nothing changes 
        except the PID, but that's exactly what is needed here.
        
        First fork before the setsid makes sure the process is not a process 
        group leader. That is required for a succesfull setsid.
        
        The second fork after the setsid makes sure that a new association 
        with a controlling terminal won't be started merely by opening a 
        terminal device."""
